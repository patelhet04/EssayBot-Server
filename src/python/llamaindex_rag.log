========== ASSIGNMENT QUESTION ==========
How has Southwest Airlines used its unique organizational culture and human resource practices to gain a competitive advantage in the airline industry, and do you think these practices are sustainable in the face of growing competition from United’s Shuttle and Continental Lite?
========== END OF QUESTION ==========   

========== STUDENT ESSAY (ONLY SOURCE FOR QUOTES) ==========
Southwest Airlines has always stood out in the airline industry due to its fun, people-first culture. Unlike traditional companies, Southwest puts a strong focus on hiring individuals with the right attitude—people who are team players and can bring humor, flexibility, and empathy to the workplace. Even flight attendants and pilots are expected to help with tasks like cleaning planes or assisting customers. These practices make the company more efficient and approachable, helping them maintain low operational costs while building strong relationships with both employees and customers. Their “no frills” model—no assigned seating, no meals, just peanuts and smiles—matches their casual and friendly brand.

Still, staying on top isn’t easy. Big airlines like United and Continental are now trying to copy Southwest’s model by launching their own budget airlines. But what they lack is the internal spirit—Southwest’s employees see the company as a family and a mission. Culture isn’t something you can build overnight, and without trust, humor, and shared values, other airlines might struggle to truly match Southwest’s success. If Southwest keeps hiring the right people and adapting its culture as it grows, it’s got a good shot at staying ahead.

Title: Week 2: Building a Competitive Advantage

 


Building a Competitive Advantage
Building a Competitive Advantage
Overview:
Understanding how firms are structured is essential to determining how firms compete. The source of a firm’s strengths and weaknesses can then be leveraged or minimized.
In order to determine how firms remain competitive, it is important to understand how firms are structured. 
As part of this process, Porter’s Five Forces model of industry competitiveness is applied for a detailed industry consideration.
The internal environment of a firm is considered from a strengths and weaknesses perspective to relate internal strengths and weaknesses to opportunities and threats. This SWOT matrix method assists in identification of firm capabilities that can lead to a competitive advantage in the form of a special capability that is called a core competence.
By the end of this lesson you will have the tools to examine a firm’s external and internal environments and analyze these to determine a firm’s capabilities that may yield a competitive advantage.
 

 


“
From the reading: "Note on the Value Chain: A Framework for Analyzing a Firm's Activities, WDI Publishing 3 pages”
“Another strategy might lead to 10 percent lower costs and 5 percent lower price. Companies such as IKEA and Southwest have chosen this kind of structure. Where the net result of the configuration is positive, the strategy has, by definition, created competitive advantage.”
From "Competitive Advantage, the value chain and your P&L, Applying Michael Porter's Value Chain Framework to your Business, Joan Magretta, 32 pages",
 


Think about how external factors could eventually work with the value chain. Eg: supplier partnerships and procurement or inbound logistics. Toyota and Walmart are known for tight collaborations with suppliers. Delivery fleets, co-location and close relations (resources) enable for just in time delivery (capability).
In the SWOT analysis template tool, parts of the value chain can be placed under resources or capabilities. The explicit diagram shown here is not required.
Is just-in-time delivery a core competence?

Valued by customers (yes, as the product is available quickly)
Inimitable (it is hard to copy as it involves close relations with suppliers)
Durable (mainly so if the partnerships are exclusive and long lasting)
Extracts Value/Appropriability (yes, as lower inventory benefits the retailer (but not so much the supplier)
Non-substitutable/Sustainability (yes, as there is no better way to achieve lean inventory)
Better than the competition/Competitive Superiority (less so now than in the past as more firms are using just-in-time practices)

Just-in-time is a potential strong basis for a competitive advantage, but its relative superiority depends upon the industry. As the practice has increasingly been adopted additional capabilities may be needed to maintain advantage.

========== SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS (FACT-CHECKING & REFERENCE) ==========
{{An old adage at Southw est was not to provoke their major competitors. 
Obviously, they had done more than provoke them; they had challenged them directly. 
 
Continental Lite 
 
Under the guidance of CEO Bob Ferguson, Continental Airlines emerged from its second 
bankruptcy in April 1993. In May, Ferguson announced his plan to split the company into two 
operations; one that would concentrate on short-haul , low fare flights (named Continental Lite or 
CALite), and the other that would feature first-class serv ice at business class prices. He believed 
that because of its low  cost structure, lower even than Sout hwest, Continental would be able to 
compete successfully. By imitating many of Sout hwest’s practices, including the use of humor 
by flight attendants, Ferguson believed that he could attract the business traveler. By 
concentrating primarily on the East Coast market , he could take advantage of greater density, 
shorter flights, and avoid competing directly with Southwest, at least in the short-term. 
 
Continental Lite was rolled out in October, 1993, with 173 daily departures from 14 cities. By 
summer, it had expanded to 28 percent of Continen tal’s capacity, with plans to ultimately grow 
to 40 percent. Fares were cut dramatically. }}

========== ASSIGNMENT QUESTION ==========
How has Southwest Airlines used its unique organizational culture and human resource practices to gain a competitive advantage in the airline industry, and do you think these practices are sustainable in the face of growing competition from United’s Shuttle and Continental Lite?
========== END OF QUESTION ==========   

========== STUDENT ESSAY (ONLY SOURCE FOR QUOTES) ==========
Southwest Airlines has always stood out in the airline industry due to its fun, people-first culture. Unlike traditional companies, Southwest puts a strong focus on hiring individuals with the right attitude—people who are team players and can bring humor, flexibility, and empathy to the workplace. Even flight attendants and pilots are expected to help with tasks like cleaning planes or assisting customers. These practices make the company more efficient and approachable, helping them maintain low operational costs while building strong relationships with both employees and customers. Their “no frills” model—no assigned seating, no meals, just peanuts and smiles—matches their casual and friendly brand.

Still, staying on top isn’t easy. Big airlines like United and Continental are now trying to copy Southwest’s model by launching their own budget airlines. But what they lack is the internal spirit—Southwest’s employees see the company as a family and a mission. Culture isn’t something you can build overnight, and without trust, humor, and shared values, other airlines might struggle to truly match Southwest’s success. If Southwest keeps hiring the right people and adapting its culture as it grows, it’s got a good shot at staying ahead.

Building a Competitive Advantage
Building a Competitive Advantage
Overview:
Understanding how firms are structured is essential to determining how firms compete. The source of a firm’s strengths and weaknesses can then be leveraged or minimized.
In order to determine how firms remain competitive, it is important to understand how firms are structured. 
As part of this process, Porter’s Five Forces model of industry competitiveness is applied for a detailed industry consideration.
The internal environment of a firm is considered from a strengths and weaknesses perspective to relate internal strengths and weaknesses to opportunities and threats. This SWOT matrix method assists in identification of firm capabilities that can lead to a competitive advantage in the form of a special capability that is called a core competence.
By the end of this lesson you will have the tools to examine a firm’s external and internal environments and analyze these to determine a firm’s capabilities that may yield a competitive advantage.
 

 


“
From the reading: "Note on the Value Chain: A Framework for Analyzing a Firm's Activities, WDI Publishing 3 pages”
“Another strategy might lead to 10 percent lower costs and 5 percent lower price. Companies such as IKEA and Southwest have chosen this kind of structure. Where the net result of the configuration is positive, the strategy has, by definition, created competitive advantage.”
From "Competitive Advantage, the value chain and your P&L, Applying Michael Porter's Value Chain Framework to your Business, Joan Magretta, 32 pages",
 


Think about how external factors could eventually work with the value chain. Eg: supplier partnerships and procurement or inbound logistics. Toyota and Walmart are known for tight collaborations with suppliers. Delivery fleets, co-location and close relations (resources) enable for just in time delivery (capability).
In the SWOT analysis template tool, parts of the value chain can be placed under resources or capabilities. The explicit diagram shown here is not required.
Is just-in-time delivery a core competence?

Valued by customers (yes, as the product is available quickly)
Inimitable (it is hard to copy as it involves close relations with suppliers)
Durable (mainly so if the partnerships are exclusive and long lasting)
Extracts Value/Appropriability (yes, as lower inventory benefits the retailer (but not so much the supplier)
Non-substitutable/Sustainability (yes, as there is no better way to achieve lean inventory)
Better than the competition/Competitive Superiority (less so now than in the past as more firms are using just-in-time practices)

Just-in-time is a potential strong basis for a competitive advantage, but its relative superiority depends upon the industry. As the practice has increasingly been adopted additional capabilities may be needed to maintain advantage.

Continental Lite 
 
Under the guidance of CEO Bob Ferguson, Continental Airlines emerged from its second 
bankruptcy in April 1993. In May, Ferguson announced his plan to split the company into two 
operations; one that would concentrate on short-haul , low fare flights (named Continental Lite or 
CALite), and the other that would feature first-class serv ice at business class prices. He believed 
that because of its low  cost structure, lower even than Sout hwest, Continental would be able to 
compete successfully. By imitating many of Sout hwest’s practices, including the use of humor 
by flight attendants, Ferguson believed that he could attract the business traveler. By 
concentrating primarily on the East Coast market , he could take advantage of greater density, 
shorter flights, and avoid competing directly with Southwest, at least in the short-term. 
 
Continental Lite was rolled out in October, 1993, with 173 daily departures from 14 cities. By 
summer, it had expanded to 28 percent of Continen tal’s capacity, with plans to ultimately grow 
to 40 percent. Fares were cut dramatically. }}

========== ASSIGNMENT QUESTION ==========
How has Southwest Airlines used its unique organizational culture and human resource practices to gain a competitive advantage in the airline industry, and do you think these practices are sustainable in the face of growing competition from United’s Shuttle and Continental Lite?
========== END OF QUESTION ==========   

========== STUDENT ESSAY (ONLY SOURCE FOR QUOTES) ==========
Southwest Airlines has always stood out in the airline industry due to its fun, people-first culture. Unlike traditional companies, Southwest puts a strong focus on hiring individuals with the right attitude—people who are team players and can bring humor, flexibility, and empathy to the workplace. Even flight attendants and pilots are expected to help with tasks like cleaning planes or assisting customers. These practices make the company more efficient and approachable, helping them maintain low operational costs while building strong relationships with both employees and customers. Their “no frills” model—no assigned seating, no meals, just peanuts and smiles—matches their casual and friendly brand.

Still, staying on top isn’t easy. Big airlines like United and Continental are now trying to copy Southwest’s model by launching their own budget airlines. But what they lack is the internal spirit—Southwest’s employees see the company as a family and a mission. Culture isn’t something you can build overnight, and without trust, humor, and shared values, other airlines might struggle to truly match Southwest’s success. If Southwest keeps hiring the right people and adapting its culture as it grows, it’s got a good shot at staying ahead.

Title: Week 2: Building a Competitive Advantage

 


Building a Competitive Advantage
Building a Competitive Advantage
Overview:
Understanding how firms are structured is essential to determining how firms compete. The source of a firm’s strengths and weaknesses can then be leveraged or minimized.
In order to determine how firms remain competitive, it is important to understand how firms are structured. 
As part of this process, Porter’s Five Forces model of industry competitiveness is applied for a detailed industry consideration.
The internal environment of a firm is considered from a strengths and weaknesses perspective to relate internal strengths and weaknesses to opportunities and threats. This SWOT matrix method assists in identification of firm capabilities that can lead to a competitive advantage in the form of a special capability that is called a core competence.
By the end of this lesson you will have the tools to examine a firm’s external and internal environments and analyze these to determine a firm’s capabilities that may yield a competitive advantage.
 

 


“
From the reading: "Note on the Value Chain: A Framework for Analyzing a Firm's Activities, WDI Publishing 3 pages”
“Another strategy might lead to 10 percent lower costs and 5 percent lower price. Companies such as IKEA and Southwest have chosen this kind of structure. Where the net result of the configuration is positive, the strategy has, by definition, created competitive advantage.”
From "Competitive Advantage, the value chain and your P&L, Applying Michael Porter's Value Chain Framework to your Business, Joan Magretta, 32 pages",
 


Think about how external factors could eventually work with the value chain. Eg: supplier partnerships and procurement or inbound logistics. Toyota and Walmart are known for tight collaborations with suppliers. Delivery fleets, co-location and close relations (resources) enable for just in time delivery (capability).
In the SWOT analysis template tool, parts of the value chain can be placed under resources or capabilities. The explicit diagram shown here is not required.
Is just-in-time delivery a core competence?

Valued by customers (yes, as the product is available quickly)
Inimitable (it is hard to copy as it involves close relations with suppliers)
Durable (mainly so if the partnerships are exclusive and long lasting)
Extracts Value/Appropriability (yes, as lower inventory benefits the retailer (but not so much the supplier)
Non-substitutable/Sustainability (yes, as there is no better way to achieve lean inventory)
Better than the competition/Competitive Superiority (less so now than in the past as more firms are using just-in-time practices)

Just-in-time is a potential strong basis for a competitive advantage, but its relative superiority depends upon the industry. As the practice has increasingly been adopted additional capabilities may be needed to maintain advantage.

Continental Lite 
 
Under the guidance of CEO Bob Ferguson, Continental Airlines emerged from its second 
bankruptcy in April 1993. In May, Ferguson announced his plan to split the company into two 
operations; one that would concentrate on short-haul , low fare flights (named Continental Lite or 
CALite), and the other that would feature first-class serv ice at business class prices. He believed 
that because of its low  cost structure, lower even than Sout hwest, Continental would be able to 
compete successfully. By imitating many of Sout hwest’s practices, including the use of humor 
by flight attendants, Ferguson believed that he could attract the business traveler. By 
concentrating primarily on the East Coast market , he could take advantage of greater density, 
shorter flights, and avoid competing directly with Southwest, at least in the short-term. 
 
Continental Lite was rolled out in October, 1993, with 173 daily departures from 14 cities. By 
summer, it had expanded to 28 percent of Continen tal’s capacity, with plans to ultimately grow 
to 40 percent. Fares were cut dramatically. }}

========== STUDENT ESSAY (ONLY SOURCE FOR QUOTES) ==========
Southwest Airlines has always stood out in the airline industry due to its fun, people-first culture. Unlike traditional companies, Southwest puts a strong focus on hiring individuals with the right attitude—people who are team players and can bring humor, flexibility, and empathy to the workplace. Even flight attendants and pilots are expected to help with tasks like cleaning planes or assisting customers. These practices make the company more efficient and approachable, helping them maintain low operational costs while building strong relationships with both employees and customers. Their “no frills” model—no assigned seating, no meals, just peanuts and smiles—matches their casual and friendly brand.

Still, staying on top isn’t easy. Big airlines like United and Continental are now trying to copy Southwest’s model by launching their own budget airlines. But what they lack is the internal spirit—Southwest’s employees see the company as a family and a mission. Culture isn’t something you can build overnight, and without trust, humor, and shared values, other airlines might struggle to truly match Southwest’s success. If Southwest keeps hiring the right people and adapting its culture as it grows, it’s got a good shot at staying ahead.

Continental Lite 
 
Under the guidance of CEO Bob Ferguson, Continental Airlines emerged from its second 
bankruptcy in April 1993. In May, Ferguson announced his plan to split the company into two 
operations; one that would concentrate on short-haul , low fare flights (named Continental Lite or 
CALite), and the other that would feature first-class serv ice at business class prices. He believed 
that because of its low  cost structure, lower even than Sout hwest, Continental would be able to 
compete successfully. By imitating many of Sout hwest’s practices, including the use of humor 
by flight attendants, Ferguson believed that he could attract the business traveler. By 
concentrating primarily on the East Coast market , he could take advantage of greater density, 
shorter flights, and avoid competing directly with Southwest, at least in the short-term. 
 
Continental Lite was rolled out in October, 1993, with 173 daily departures from 14 cities. By 
summer, it had expanded to 28 percent of Continen tal’s capacity, with plans to ultimately grow 
to 40 percent. Fares were cut dramatically. }}
